Details on vertebral shape data:

Each sheet corresponds to one specimen.
Sheets are sorted alphabetically based on species names.

For each specimen, its species name and museum collection number are noted in the first cell of the sheet (A1).

Each row of the sheet correspond to a single vertebra with its number listed in the first column:
T = Thoracic vertebrae, L = Lumbar vertebrae, Ca = Caudal vertebrae (anterior to fluke insertion).

Each column of the sheet corresponds to a linear or vertebral measurement.
Linear measurements are expressed in centimeters.
Angular ones are in degrees (90âˆž = perpendicular, <90 = anteriorly oriented, >90 = posteriorly oriented)
For more details about measurements, see figure S1 of the Supplementary materials of the original publication.

NA values correspond to broken parts of vertebrae or missing vertebrae.
For neural spines inclination, transverse processes inclination and metapophyses height, NA were used when the corresponding apophyse was not present.
