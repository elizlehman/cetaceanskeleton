Cetacean Vertebrae Analysis
--
Description
-
This project analyzes vertebral shape data from 73 cetacean species using principal component analysis (PCA) and generalizaed linear mixed models (GLMM). This project's objectives are to recognize patterns of vertebral morphology among various cetacean species and investigating how vertebral shape is affected by adjacent vertebrae and their taxonomy. The results from this study may apply more broadly to our understanding of cetacean evolutionary pathways relative to their ecology and how these vertebral modifications may have operated as evolutionary advantages between smaller riverine, coastal, and oceanic cetacean species.

Analysis Methodology
-
- Measurements of each specimen's vertebrae are analyzed using PCA and GLMM to identify patterns and variations in vertebral shape across species.
